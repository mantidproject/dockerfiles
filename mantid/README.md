# Mantid in Docker

Run [mantid](https://www.mantidproject.org) in Docker.

## Usage

MantidPlot:
```sh
docker run \
  --rm \
  --ipc=host \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
  mantidproject/mantid:3.13.0_ubuntu16.04 \
  mantidplot
```

Note that the instrument view does not work using this method.

Mantid Python:
```sh
docker run \
  --rm -it \
  mantidproject/mantid:3.13.0_ubuntu16.04 \
  mantidpython
```

[x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker) can be used to enable
advanced graphics features (instrument view, VSI, etc.) and is the only way to
run the new workbench:
```sh
x11docker \
  --hostipc \
  --xpra \
  mantidproject/mantid /
  mantidplot
```

You will more than likely want to assign some volumes to access data too.

## Building

This details how to build images.
This is mostly intended for developers maintaining the images.

If any part of these steps is unclear don't push anything you create to DockerHub under the `mantidproject` organisation.
By all means build images but make sure you have done what you expected to do before pushing anything.

All images can built as a single script by running `scripts/build_all.sh` this also has the advantage of making sure the images are built in the correct order, for example if the developer images are updated

`scripts/push_all.sh` will push all locally tagged images. It's important to make sure `build_all.sh` has run before and that the images are what you expect.

### Release

TODO

### Nightly

This should mainly be done by Jenkins, but if for some reason it must be done manually follow these steps (this assumes you are using Bash):

1. Download the binary from the nightly build you want to package, place it in this directory (the one with the `*.Dockerfile`s).
2. Load the build helpers: `. build_helpers.sh`
3. Build the image: `build_image [dockerfile] [tag] [package file] [path additions]`
  - `[dockerfile]` is the Dockerfile used to build the image, it should be one from this directory
  - `[tag]` is the tag to apply to the image, this should follow the format described in the section above
  - `[package file]` is the filename of the package you downloaded in step 1
  - `[path additions]` is a list of paths to add to the `PATH` environment variable, this should be set according to the target OS and nightly type

The `jenkins_build_nightly.sh` script can be inspected to see how this should work automatically.
This script should be enough to give you some hints if anything is unclear.
